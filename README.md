# SomeTools
This is for some small tools i write in work or spare time

1. VS Performance Tool

  This tool help me to track our engine's performance. As I am continuing to change codes in our engine side and its performance
is a important data I need to watch. So this tool can store every time I run the performance test and draw a plot and other 
things I am interesting. Such as, it can list all the Top100 expensive functions.

  The process is written in batch file, thus I can easily use. As the engine is written in C++/C#, thus I can use VsPerfCmd, 
which can give a whole data during engine running. Then I can analyse the data. Here, I use Python to do this job. After analysing,
a html report is created.
